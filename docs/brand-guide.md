Avoid:
- "Revolutionary travel quiz platform" (too corporate)

## Don'ts

- Don't use the tagline without the logo
- Don't add text to the app icon
- Don't use all caps for "tripto" (except in specific design contexts like all-caps headlines)
- Don't use bright, saturated colors outside the defined palette
- Don't use serif fonts or heavy, condensed typography
- Don't describe tripto as "quiz" or "trivia" exclusively — it's a "party game"
